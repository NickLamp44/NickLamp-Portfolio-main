From a young age, I've had a natural curiosity for all things mechanical and digital. Wheather it's Cars, Bikes, Planes, or Ipods,Computers and Game Systems. This lifelong passion led me to explore these various topics throughout my time in High School. I was lucky enough to have access to  classes in web development, where I built my first websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Graphic design, where we utilized tools such as Lightroom and Photoshop to create various digital works of art. Intro to Mechanics class where we learned first hand how to complete basic and more complex matenance tasks on donor cars that were in the shop.  Little did i know, that initial taste of coding and design would plant the seed that would drive me to a career in Tech. I am a creative problem solver with a keen eye for detail and a strong desire to learn and grow. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and create with fellow developers.

After high school, unsure of which path to take and feeling overwhelmed by options, I chose what i felt would be the safer route with a degree in Marketing. Yet, my fascination with tech never faded. Throughout college, I kept feeding my curiosity with classes in Internet Marketing, Python, and an Intro to CS course. Post College I started my professional career in real estate management with the Bozzuto Group. I was resposible for the marketing and leasing of various High Rise apartment communities across Boston. It took a while but i finally realized that my love for building needed to be at the forefront of my career, so I pivoted to tech, exploring UX/UI design, then front-end development, and ultimately finding my place as a full-stack web developer.

Today, I'm thrilled to be combining my background in design and marketing with my technical skills. I've completed a variety of passion projects that showcase my journey and evolving expertise. Web development allows me to fulfill that creative urge, blending problem-solving with design to build practical, user-focused solutions. Each project not only sharpens my skills but also keeps me excited about what's next in this ever-changing field.
